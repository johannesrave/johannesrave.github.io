# Automotive Modelling

Even while studying product design I was always drawn towards the logical and geometric aspects of design. I liked building stuff on the computer as well, and after my time as a night-club owner ended I began working as a professional 3D-modeller in the German car industry - the technical term is Computer Aided Surfacing or CAS (as opposed to CAD, which is more concerned with the technical aspects of development).

In the course of my career at Uedelhoven Studios and Design Consulting I worked on the design surfacing and sculpture of many projects in different capacities for customers such as Audi, BMW, Volkswagen, Skoda, Bentley and Bugatti. Many of these projects are contenders in internal design competitions, and our work in it happens at a very early stage or never sees the light of day at all. But some of the cars have won their competitions and are in production now.

All of the data created working for the OEMs is of course confidential, so I can't directly show any of it or even render images for my own use.

I'm therefore posting links to cars I was involved with on netcarshow.com, the most popular automotive database that holds most modern cars. I don't hold rights to any of the images.
