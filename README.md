## Nightclub _wolf_

In 2012 I founded [_wolf_](https://www.facebook.com/wolfimbuch), a 600sqm nightclub in the cellar of a brewery in Pforzheim.  
It ran on great music, an honest amotsphere and a terrific staff of up to 16 people until January 2014.
The facebook page includes pictures of the location and events, and features the visual art style of our promotional material.
